<h1>Hey, I'm Mac 👋</h1>

### Builder | CEO @ [Incubrain](https://github.com/incubrain) | CTO @ [AstronEra](https://astronera.org)

- 🧠 I build AI-native products from scratch, blending business strategy with full-stack execution.
- 🛠️ I work primarily with **TypeScript** across a **microservices architecture** using **Docker**, **PostgreSQL** for structured data, **Milvus** for vector stores, and **Mastra** for agentic programming.
- 🌍 I use **Nuxt** for frontend apps and integrate with all the major **AI APIs** to automate the work of 10 people.
- 🧩 I focus on tools that people actually use — and believe a great product needs both top-down clarity and bottom-up execution.
- 🗣️ I speak business with CEOs and architecture with CTOs — bridging the gap between vision and implementation.
