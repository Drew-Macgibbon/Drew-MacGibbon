# 👋 Hello, I'm Drew! 

I believe that my wealth of knowledge will be immensely valuable for any development team, especially if you’re using Vue and are a small to medium size business.

![Drew's Github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Drew-Macgibbon&count_private=true)


My strength is my diverse experience in business/full-stack development/marketing & design which allows me to develop products/features from a business-first angle. Why do I say this?

- ✔ For 10 years I’ve been working on startups, including many of my own.
- ✔ For the past 4 years I’ve been working as a Full-Stack Developer.
- ✔ I’m currently the CEO of one company, and CTO of another that’s funded.
- ✔ I have extensive Open Source knowledge, which should save you money!
- ✔ Every day I learn new skills improving my ability to create better products. 
 
With this experience comes the ability to communicate clearly what needs to be done and explain my thinking behind it. I’m not afraid to challenge your ideas if I think I have a better solution, but happy to admit when your idea is better.

I’m currently living in India as I scale my own businesses, this is why I’m seeking some extra funds. It’s also because of this that I’m able to offer my services at an extremely competitive rate.

I’m happy to provide my services on a consultant basis or as a developer/business development expert for up to 30 hours per week.
