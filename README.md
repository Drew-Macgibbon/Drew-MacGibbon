## Links About Me
- [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drew-macgibbon/)
- [Portfolio](https://www.incubrain.org/)

**I am a Vue / Nuxt / Typescript / Supabase expert** with full-stack capabilities and a background in business. I've been using Nuxt 3 in all my development projects since the first release candidate was released. I've moved to India, started my development company, and am in the process of finding projects/hiring a team.

## Open to Work

Ideally, I'm looking for **long-term partnerships** to help founders bring their vision to life, scaling a team around their product with a managed team. 
I am open to once-off projects if you are flexible on the technology stack, and provide designs.

I'm a life-long learner and aim to upskill my development knowledge on a daily basis. This could be in the form of research, learning a new technology, browsing GitHub, using ChatGPT, working on personal projects, and testing my knowledge with coding challenges. Because of this, I am up to date with all the current developments in my chosen stack and aware of most libraries and technologies required to build a modern application.
